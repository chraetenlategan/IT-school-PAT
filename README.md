# IT-school-PAT
This is my Grade 12 IT PAT for 2025. The task was to create a fully functional Delphi application demonstrating all the core concepts we learned in school — including arrays, OOP principles, database programming, and SQL — along with several other techniques covered throughout the IT curriculum.

# IT PAT – Airplane & Runway Control System (Delphi Project)
